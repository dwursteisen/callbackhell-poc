RxJava + Java 8 to get out of Callback Hell - Proof of Concept code

Most of the code is sugar-coating, the interesting parts are the MainXXX classes :
 - hell/MainHell.java
 - heaven/MainRx.java
 - heaven/MainHeaven.java

 Those are the main steps in the demo : callback-based code, same functionnality but with RxJava, and at last the code with both RxJava and Java 8 lambdas.
